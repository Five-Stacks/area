# 🎯 Creating Your First AREA

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an AREA automation workflow. Whether you're using the web or mobile application, the process is similar and intuitive.

## Overview

Creating an AREA involves:
1. **Logging in** to your account
2. **Choosing a trigger** (the event that starts the automation)
3. **Choosing one or more actions** (what happens when triggered)
4. **Naming and saving** your AREA

The entire process happens from the **Dashboard** and is identical on web and mobile platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an AREA, make sure you:

1. ✅ Have an account on the AREA platform
2. ✅ Are **logged in** to the web or mobile application
3. ✅ Have connected at least one service (GitHub, Discord, Spotify, etc.)

:::tip Connecting Services
If you haven't connected any services yet, check:
- [Web App: Services Management](/user-guide/web-app#services-management)
- [Mobile App: Services Tab](/user-guide/mobile-app#services-tab)
:::

:::info Key Concept
- **One Trigger** → Can have **Multiple Actions**
- Actions execute in the order you set them
- All actions run when the trigger fires
:::

### Step 3: Choose the Actions (Reactions)

What happens when the trigger fires. You can add multiple reactions!

#### 3.1 Choose the Service
1. Select the service for the reaction
2. Can be the same or different from the trigger service

#### 3.2 Choose the Reaction
1. Select what action to perform
2. Examples:
   - Discord: "Send Message"
   - GitHub: "Create Issue Comment"
   - Spotify: "Add Track to Playlist"

### Step 4: Manage Actions (Optional)

You can have multiple reactions for one trigger!

#### Add More Actions
1. Click **"+ Add Action"** button
2. Repeat Step 3 for each additional reaction
3. Each reaction can use a different service

#### Remove Actions
1. Click the **trash/delete icon** on an action
2. Confirm deletion

#### Reorder Actions
1. Drag and drop actions to reorder them
2. Actions execute in the order shown
3. Top to bottom execution

:::info
Multiple reactions are useful for complex workflows, like:
- Notify Discord AND create GitHub comment
- Save to Spotify AND log to spreadsheet
:::

### Step 5: Finalize and Save

When you're satisfied with your configuration:

#### 5.1 Validate the AREA
1. Click **"Validate"** or **"Finish"** button
2. A popup/modal will appear

#### 5.2 Name Your AREA
1. In the popup, enter a descriptive name for your AREA
2. **Examples of good names:**

## Troubleshooting

### My AREA isn't triggering

**Check these common issues:**

1. ✅ **Is the AREA enabled?** Check the toggle switch
2. ✅ **Service connections active?** Verify in Settings > Services
3. ✅ **Action parameters correct?** Double-check repository names, IDs, etc.
4. ✅ **Permissions granted?** Some actions need specific OAuth scopes

### Reaction isn't working

1. ✅ **Check reaction service connection**
2. ✅ **Verify parameter formatting** (especially IDs and URLs)
3. ✅ **Test with simple parameters** first, then add complexity
4. ✅ **Review execution logs** in the AREA details page

### Variables not appearing in reaction

1. Make sure you're using the correct syntax: `{{variable.name}}`
2. Check that the variable is available from your action
3. Refer to the action documentation for available variables

## Best Practices

### ✨ Naming Convention
Use descriptive names that explain what the AREA does:
- ❌ "Area 1"
- ✅ "Notify team when prod fails"

### 🎯 Start Simple
Create simple AREAs first, then add complexity:
1. Basic action → basic reaction
2. Test and verify it works
3. Add parameters and variables
4. Refine and optimize

### 🔍 Test Before Production
1. Create a test AREA with a simple reaction (like logging to a test channel)
2. Verify it triggers correctly
3. Then modify it for production use

### 📊 Monitor Execution
- Check the execution history regularly
- Review failed executions
- Optimize based on patterns

### 🔒 Security
- Don't expose sensitive data in reactions
- Be careful with public channels
- Review permissions regularly
