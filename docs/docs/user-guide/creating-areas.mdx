# üéØ Creating Your First AREA

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an AREA automation workflow. Whether you're using the web or mobile application, the process is similar and intuitive.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an AREA, make sure you:

1. ‚úÖ Have an account on the AREA platform
2. ‚úÖ Are logged in to the web or mobile application
3. ‚úÖ Have connected at least one service (GitHub, Discord, Spotify, etc.)

:::tip
If you haven't connected any services yet, check the [Web App Guide](/user-guide/web-app#connecting-services) or [Mobile App Guide](/user-guide/mobile-app#connecting-services) for instructions.
:::

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the AREA Creation Page

#### On Web Application
1. Click on the **"AREAs"** tab in the main navigation
2. Click the **"+ Create New AREA"** button

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Create AREA Button Web](/img/user-guide/web-create-button.png) -->

#### On Mobile Application
1. Tap the **"AREA"** tab at the bottom navigation
2. Tap the **"+"** floating action button in the bottom-right corner

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Create AREA Button Mobile](/img/user-guide/mobile-create-button.png) -->

---

### Step 2: Give Your AREA a Name

Choose a descriptive name for your automation. This helps you identify it later when you have multiple AREAs.

**Examples of good names:**
- "Notify Discord on New GitHub Issue"
- "Add Starred Tracks to Playlist"
- "Tweet New Blog Posts"

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Name Your AREA](/img/user-guide/name-area.png) -->

:::info
You can always edit the name later from the AREA management page.

### Step 3: Select an Action (Trigger)

The action is what triggers your automation. 

1. Click on the **"Select Action"** dropdown
2. Browse available actions by service
3. Select the action you want to use

**Popular Actions:**
- **GitHub**: New issue created, new pull request, new star
- **Discord**: New message in channel, user joined server
- **Spotify**: Track added to playlist, new saved track
- **Microsoft**: New email received, calendar event created
- **Twitter**: New tweet from user, new mention

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Select Action](/img/user-guide/select-action.png) -->

---

### Step 4: Configure Action Parameters

Depending on the action you selected, you may need to configure specific parameters.

**Examples:**

**GitHub - New Issue Created**
- Repository name: `owner/repo-name`
- Labels to filter: `bug`, `feature` (optional)

**Discord - New Message**
- Server ID
- Channel ID

**Spotify - New Saved Track**
- No parameters needed (automatically uses your account)

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Configure Action](/img/user-guide/configure-action.png) -->

:::warning
Make sure you've granted the necessary permissions to the service when connecting it. If you see permission errors, you may need to reconnect the service with additional scopes.
:::

---

### Step 5: Select a Reaction (Response)

The reaction is what happens automatically when your action is triggered.

1. Click on the **"Select Reaction"** dropdown
2. Browse available reactions by service
3. Select the reaction you want to use

**Popular Reactions:**
- **Discord**: Send message to channel, send DM
- **GitHub**: Create issue comment, add label, close issue
- **Spotify**: Add track to playlist, save track
- **Microsoft**: Send email, create calendar event
- **Twitter**: Post tweet, send DM

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Select Reaction](/img/user-guide/select-reaction.png) -->

---

### Step 6: Configure Reaction Parameters

Configure how the reaction should behave when triggered.

**Examples:**

**Discord - Send Message**
```
Channel ID: 1234567890
Message: New issue created: {{issue.title}}
By: {{issue.author}}
URL: {{issue.url}}
```

**GitHub - Create Comment**
```
Repository: owner/repo-name
Comment: Thank you for your contribution! üéâ
We'll review this soon.
```

**Spotify - Add to Playlist**
```
Playlist ID: 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Configure Reaction](/img/user-guide/configure-reaction.png) -->

:::tip Dynamic Variables
Many reactions support dynamic variables from the action. Use double curly braces `{{variable.name}}` to insert dynamic content from your trigger.

Common variables:
- `{{user.name}}` - Triggered user
- `{{timestamp}}` - When it happened
- `{{title}}`, `{{description}}`, `{{url}}` - Common item properties
:::

### Step 7: Review and Create

Before creating your AREA:

1. **Review your configuration**:
   - ‚úì Action is correctly set up
   - ‚úì Reaction parameters are valid
   - ‚úì Name is descriptive

2. **Check the status toggle**:
   - Enable to activate immediately
   - Disable to save as draft

3. Click **"Create AREA"** or **"Save"**

## Common AREA Examples

**Action**: GitHub - New Issue Created
- Repository: `Five-Stacks/area`

**Reaction**: Discord - Send Message
- Channel ID: `123456789`
- Message: `üÜï New issue: {{issue.title}} by @{{issue.author}}`

### Example 2: Spotify Track Saver

**Action**: Spotify - New Track in Playlist
- Playlist: `Discover Weekly`

**Reaction**: Spotify - Save Track
- Automatically save track to your library

### Example 3: Twitter Auto-Reply

**Action**: Twitter - New Mention

## Troubleshooting

### My AREA isn't triggering

**Check these common issues:**

1. ‚úÖ **Is the AREA enabled?** Check the toggle switch
2. ‚úÖ **Service connections active?** Verify in Settings > Services
3. ‚úÖ **Action parameters correct?** Double-check repository names, IDs, etc.
4. ‚úÖ **Permissions granted?** Some actions need specific OAuth scopes

### Reaction isn't working

1. ‚úÖ **Check reaction service connection**
2. ‚úÖ **Verify parameter formatting** (especially IDs and URLs)
3. ‚úÖ **Test with simple parameters** first, then add complexity
4. ‚úÖ **Review execution logs** in the AREA details page

### Variables not appearing in reaction

1. Make sure you're using the correct syntax: `{{variable.name}}`
2. Check that the variable is available from your action
3. Refer to the action documentation for available variables

---

## Best Practices

### ‚ú® Naming Convention
Use descriptive names that explain what the AREA does:
- ‚ùå "Area 1"
- ‚úÖ "Notify team when prod fails"

### üéØ Start Simple
Create simple AREAs first, then add complexity:
1. Basic action ‚Üí basic reaction
2. Test and verify it works
3. Add parameters and variables
4. Refine and optimize

### üîç Test Before Production
1. Create a test AREA with a simple reaction (like logging to a test channel)
2. Verify it triggers correctly
3. Then modify it for production use

### üìä Monitor Execution
- Check the execution history regularly
- Review failed executions
- Optimize based on patterns

### üîí Security
- Don't expose sensitive data in reactions
- Be careful with public channels
- Review permissions regularly

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first AREA:

- Learn how to [manage and edit AREAs](/user-guide/managing-areas)
- Explore the [web application features](/user-guide/web-app)
- Try the [mobile application](/user-guide/mobile-app)
- Check [execution history](/user-guide/managing-areas#viewing-execution-history)

Happy automating! üöÄ
