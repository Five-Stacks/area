# üìñ User Guide Overview

Welcome to the AREA user guide! This comprehensive documentation will help you understand and use the AREA platform to create powerful automation workflows.

## What is AREA?

AREA (Action-REAction) is an automation platform that allows you to connect different services and create workflows. Similar to IFTTT or Zapier, AREA lets you automate tasks by defining:

- **Actions**: Triggers that start your automation (e.g., "When I receive an email")
- **Reactions**: What happens when the action is triggered (e.g., "Send a notification")

## Key Features

### üîó Service Integration
Connect multiple services including:
- GitHub
- Discord
- Spotify
- Microsoft
- Twitter
- And more...

### üéØ Easy Workflow Creation
Create automated workflows in just a few clicks:
1. Choose an action (trigger)
2. Select a reaction (response)
3. Configure your parameters
4. Activate your AREA!

### üì± Multi-Platform Support
Access AREA from:
- **Web Application**: Full-featured interface for desktop users
- **Mobile Application**: Native mobile experience for iOS and Android

### üîê Secure Authentication

## FAQ

### What's the difference between an Action and a Reaction?

- **Action**: The trigger that starts your workflow (e.g., "new email received", "new GitHub issue")
- **Reaction**: What happens automatically when the action is triggered (e.g., "send Discord message", "create a calendar event")

### How many AREAs can I create?

There's no limit to the number of AREAs you can create. However, each AREA consumes system resources when active, so be mindful of performance.

### Can I use the same service for both Action and Reaction?

Yes! You can create AREAs that use the same service for both the action and reaction (e.g., GitHub issue creation triggers a GitHub comment).

### Are my credentials secure?

Yes. AREA uses OAuth authentication for service connections, meaning we never store your passwords. Authentication tokens are securely encrypted and stored.

### Can I temporarily disable an AREA without deleting it?

Yes! You can toggle any AREA on/off from both the web and mobile applications. This allows you to pause automations without losing your configuration.
