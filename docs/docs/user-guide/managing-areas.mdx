# ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Your AREAs

Once you've created AREAs, you'll need to manage them - editing configurations, enabling/disabling automations, viewing execution history, and deleting workflows you no longer need.

## Viewing Your AREAs

### On Web Application

Navigate to the **AREAs** tab to see all your automations displayed in a list or grid view.

Each AREA card shows:
- üìù **Name**: Your AREA's title
- ‚ö° **Action**: The trigger service and event
- üéØ **Reaction**: The response service and action
- üîò **Status**: Enabled (active) or Disabled (paused)
- üìä **Last execution**: When it last triggered

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![AREA List View](/img/user-guide/area-list.png) -->

### On Mobile Application

Tap the **AREA** tab in the bottom navigation to view your automations.

Scroll through your AREAs with quick visual indicators for:
- ‚úÖ Active automations (green)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused automations (gray)
- ‚ùå Failed executions (red warning)

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Mobile AREA List](/img/user-guide/mobile-area-list.png) -->

## Enabling and Disabling AREAs

You can temporarily pause an AREA without deleting it. This is useful when you want to stop an automation temporarily.

### Quick Toggle

#### Web Application
1. Find the AREA in your list
2. Click the **toggle switch** on the right side
3. Green = Enabled, Gray = Disabled

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Toggle AREA Web](/img/user-guide/toggle-area-web.png) -->

#### Mobile Application
1. Locate the AREA in your list
2. Tap the **toggle switch**
3. The status updates immediately

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot - ![Toggle AREA Mobile](/img/user-guide/toggle-area-mobile.png) -->

:::tip
Disabled AREAs don't consume resources or check for triggers. This is perfect for seasonal automations or temporary workflows.

## Duplicating an AREA

Want to create a similar AREA? Duplicate an existing one to save time.

## Troubleshooting

### My AREA stopped working

**Steps to diagnose:**

1. **Check if it's enabled**: Look at the toggle status
2. **Review execution history**: Look for error messages
3. **Verify service connections**: Go to Settings > Services
4. **Check parameters**: Ensure IDs, names, and URLs are still valid
5. **Test the action**: Manually trigger the action to see if it works

### Execution history shows failures

**Common causes:**

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Authentication failed | Reconnect the service in Settings |
| Invalid parameter | Check parameter format (IDs, URLs) |
| Service unavailable | Try again later or check service status |
| Permission denied | Re-authenticate with required scopes |
| Rate limit exceeded | Reduce frequency or wait |

### Can't edit or delete an AREA

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check if you're the owner of the AREA
3. Try refreshing the page/app
4. Check your internet connection

## Best Practices

### üìã Regular Maintenance

- Review your AREAs monthly
- Delete unused automations
- Update parameters as services change
- Check execution history for errors

### üè∑Ô∏è Organized Naming

Use consistent naming patterns:
- `[Service] Action ‚Üí Reaction`
- Example: `[GitHub] New Issue ‚Üí Discord Alert`

### üéØ Monitor Performance

- Check execution history weekly
- Identify frequently failing AREAs
- Optimize or disable problematic automations

### üîí Security Review

- Regularly audit service permissions
- Remove unused service connections
- Review AREAs that post public content

### üìä Optimize Resources

- Disable seasonal AREAs when not needed
- Consolidate similar AREAs when possible
- Remove duplicate automations

## Advanced Tips

### Using Variables Effectively

When editing reactions, leverage all available variables:

```
‚ùå Bad: "Something happened"
‚úÖ Good: "{{action.service}}: {{title}} by {{author}} at {{timestamp}}"
```

### Conditional Logic

Some reactions support conditional parameters. Check the service documentation for:
- If/then logic
- Variable transformations
- Filter conditions

### Chaining AREAs

Create complex workflows by chaining multiple AREAs:
1. AREA 1: GitHub Issue ‚Üí Create Google Doc
2. AREA 2: Google Doc Created ‚Üí Send Email
3. AREA 3: Email Sent ‚Üí Log to Spreadsheet
