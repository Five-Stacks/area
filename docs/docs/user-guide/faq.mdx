# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about the AREA platform. Can't find what you're looking for? Ask in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/area) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Five-Stacks/area/discussions).

## General Questions

### What is AREA?

AREA (Action-REAction) is an automation platform that connects different services and creates workflows. It's similar to IFTTT or Zapier, allowing you to automate tasks by defining triggers (actions) and responses (reactions).

### Is AREA free to use?

Yes, AREA is open-source and free to use. You can self-host it or use our hosted version. Some services may have their own rate limits or premium features.

### What's the difference between an Action and a Reaction?

- **Action**: The trigger that starts your workflow (e.g., "new email received", "GitHub issue created")
- **Reaction**: What happens automatically when the action triggers (e.g., "send Discord message", "create calendar event")

### How many AREAs can I create?

There's no hard limit on the number of AREAs you can create. However, each active AREA consumes system resources, so be mindful of:
- API rate limits from services
- Server capacity (if self-hosting)
- Your own organizational needs

### Can I use AREA offline?

The mobile app has limited offline functionality:
- ‚úÖ View existing AREAs
- ‚úÖ Check execution history
- ‚ùå Cannot create new AREAs
- ‚ùå Cannot execute automations

Full functionality requires internet connection.

## Services & Connections

### How do I connect a service?

**Web:**
1. Navigate to Services page
2. Click "Connect" on desired service
3. Authenticate via OAuth
4. Grant permissions
5. Return to AREA (automatic)

**Mobile:**
1. Go to Services tab
2. Tap on service
3. Tap "Connect"
4. Follow OAuth flow

See [Web App Guide](/user-guide/web-app#connecting-services) or [Mobile App Guide](/user-guide/mobile-app#connecting-services) for detailed instructions.

### Why can't I connect a service?

**Common issues:**

1. **Popup blocked**: Disable popup blocker for AREA
2. **Third-party cookies disabled**: Enable in browser settings
3. **Service downtime**: Check service status page
4. **Invalid credentials**: Verify your service login works
5. **Network issues**: Check internet connection

**Solution:** Try incognito/private browsing mode or different browser.

### Do I need to reconnect services regularly?

Usually no, but you may need to reconnect if:
- OAuth token expires (varies by service)
- You change your service password
- Service permissions change
- You see "Authentication Failed" errors

AREA will notify you when reconnection is needed.

### Can I use multiple accounts for the same service?

Not simultaneously for one AREA account. Each service can only have one connected account at a time.

**Workaround:** Create separate AREA accounts for different service accounts.

### What if a service I need isn't available?

You have several options:
1. **Request it**: Open a feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Five-Stacks/area/issues)
2. **Vote**: Check existing requests and upvote
3. **Contribute**: Build the integration yourself (see [Contributing Guide](/guides/contributing))
4. **Use webhooks**: Advanced users can use custom webhooks

## Creating & Managing AREAs

### My AREA isn't triggering. Why?

**Checklist:**

1. ‚úÖ **Is it enabled?** Check the toggle switch
2. ‚úÖ **Services connected?** Verify in Services page
3. ‚úÖ **Correct parameters?** Double-check IDs, names, URLs
4. ‚úÖ **Permissions granted?** Ensure proper OAuth scopes
5. ‚úÖ **Trigger occurred?** Make sure the action actually happened

**Debug:**
- Check execution history for errors
- Test with simple parameters first
- Review service connection status
- Check API rate limits

### Can I test an AREA before enabling it?

Not directly, but you can:
1. Create the AREA
2. Enable it temporarily
3. Manually trigger the action
4. Check execution history
5. Disable if not working correctly

**Best Practice:** Start with simple configurations and add complexity gradually.

### How do I know if my AREA executed successfully?

**Check execution history:**

**Web:**
1. Click on the AREA
2. Go to "Execution History" tab
3. See status (‚úÖ success / ‚ùå failed)

**Mobile:**
1. Tap on the AREA
2. Swipe to "History" tab
3. View recent executions

**Enable notifications:**
- Profile ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications
- Enable "Execution Alerts"

### Can I edit the action or reaction type after creation?

‚ùå No, you cannot change the action or reaction service type.

**Solution:** Create a new AREA with the desired configuration.

**What you CAN edit:**
- ‚úÖ AREA name
- ‚úÖ Action parameters
- ‚úÖ Reaction parameters
- ‚úÖ Enabled/disabled status

### How do I temporarily disable an AREA?

**Web:** Click the toggle switch on the AREA card or detail page

**Mobile:** Tap the toggle switch

**Disabled AREAs:**
- Won't check for triggers
- Won't execute reactions
- Keep their configuration
- Can be re-enabled anytime

Perfect for seasonal automations or testing!

### Can I duplicate an AREA?

‚ùå NO...

## Execution & Performance

### How often does AREA check for triggers?

Depends on the action type:
- **Webhooks**: Instant (real-time)
- **Polling**: Every 1-5 minutes (varies by service)
- **Event-based**: When the event occurs

Some services support webhooks for better performance.

### Why is there a delay in execution?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Polling interval**: Not webhook-based (1-5 min delay)
2. **API rate limits**: Throttled by service
3. **Server load**: High usage periods
4. **Network latency**: Internet connection issues
5. **Queue processing**: Multiple executions queued

**Normal:** 1-5 minute delays are typical for polling-based actions.
**Concerning:** 10+ minute delays - check execution logs.

### What are API rate limits?

Services limit how many API calls you can make per hour/day.

**Example limits:**
- GitHub: 5,000 requests/hour
- Twitter: 300 tweets/3 hours
- Spotify: Varies by endpoint

**If you hit limits:**
- ‚ùå AREA will fail temporarily
- ‚è≥ Will retry after cooldown
- üìä Check service documentation for limits

**Tip:** Don't poll too frequently!

### Can an AREA trigger multiple times for the same event?

Usually no, AREA tracks processed events to prevent duplicates.

**Exception:** If you delete and recreate an AREA, it may reprocess recent events.

## Troubleshooting

### I see "Authentication Failed" errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Reconnect the service:**
   - Services ‚Üí Select service ‚Üí Disconnect
   - Connect again with fresh authentication

2. **Check service status:**
   - Service may be down temporarily
   - Check their status page

3. **Verify credentials:**
   - Can you log in to the service directly?
   - Try resetting service password

4. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Clear cookies and cache
   - Try again

### My reaction isn't working

**Debug steps:**

1. ‚úÖ **Check service connection**: Is reaction service connected?
2. ‚úÖ **Verify parameters**: Are IDs, URLs correct?
3. ‚úÖ **Test variables**: Are you using correct variable names?
4. ‚úÖ **Check permissions**: Does service have required permissions?
5. ‚úÖ **Review logs**: What error message appears?

**Common issues:**
- Invalid channel/repository IDs
- Missing permissions
- Incorrect variable syntax
- Service rate limits


### Browser notifications not working

2. **App update**: May require re-login
3. **Account changes**: Password changed on web

**Solutions:**
- Enable biometric authentication for quicker login
- Use "Remember Me" option
- Check for app updates

### Page loads slowly

**Solutions:**
