## GET `/api/oauth/github`

Initiate the GitHub OAuth login/link flow. Redirects the user to GitHub's authorization page.

- Authentication: Requires the user to be authenticated (session cookie / JWT) because the server links the provider to an existing user.
- Optional `redirect_to` query param will be encoded into `state` and restored after callback.

### Response

- **302 Found (Redirect)** — Redirects to GitHub's authorization URL.

### Example

```bash
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/oauth/github?redirect_to=/profile" \
  --cookie "token=your_jwt_token"
```


## GET `/api/oauth/github/callback`

The callback endpoint GitHub calls after user authorizes. On success the server will redirect back to the original `redirect_to` or `/`. On failure it redirects to `/login`.

### Response

- **302 Found (Redirect)** — Success -> original `redirect_to` (or `/`); Failure -> `/login`.

### Notes

- Scopes requested by the server include email and repo-related scopes; see server config for details.
